====

- Fix PK modelling cmd line script (done)
- Add T10 calculation command line script (done)
- Add CNR restriction option to PK modelling
- Add smoothing for the maps
- Update documentation and links from help buttons
- add tests for pkmodelling and T10 mapping
- use TravisCI to build for ubuntu and osx
- ...
- Profit?

- Just use as a viewer for supervoxels. Possible add script later on

# idea:

- Use this viewer to view subregions in my bag of words approach
- release this viewer with that paper
- possibly also show subregions for these words and pk maps of the subregions for effect
