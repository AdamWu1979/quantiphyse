Quantiphyse is a viewing and analysis tool for 3D and 4D biomedical data. It is particularly suited 
for physiological or functional imaging data comprised of multi volumes in a 4D (time-) series 
and/or multimodal imaging data. Quantiphyse is built around the concept of making spatially 
resolved measurements of physical or physiological processes from imaging data using either 
model-based or model-free methods, in a large part exploiting Bayesian inference techniques.
Quantiphyse can analyse data both voxelwise or within regions of interest that may be manually or 
automatically created, e.g. supervoxel or clustering methods.
