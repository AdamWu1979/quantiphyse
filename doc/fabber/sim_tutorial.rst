Simple Simulated Fabber Data
============================

This tutorial walks you through generating simulated data for a simple
'toy' model and re-fitting the same data using the same model it was 
generated from.

We will use the 'polynomial' model which generates data based on a 
polynomial model. This is not of physiological interest but it is helpful
to show the concepts.
