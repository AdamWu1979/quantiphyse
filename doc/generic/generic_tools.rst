Visualisation and processing tools
==================================

The following tools are 'generic' in the sense that they are not specific to
any particular type of imaging data. Within the widgets menu they are
generally categorized as:

  - *Visualisation* - i.e. providing visual information about data without changing it
  - *Processing* - tools which change data in some way, or generate new data from existing
  - *ROI* - tools for working specifically with regions of interest
  - *Utilities* - Miscellaneous tools that typically manipulate data in more fundamental ways
  - *Simulation* - Tools for generating simulated data sets for experimental or testing purposes
