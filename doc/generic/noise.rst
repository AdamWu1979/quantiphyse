Add Noise

*Widgets -> Simulation -> Add Noise*

This widget adds Gaussian noise to an existing data set. For example it can be used to apply varying levels
of noise to 'clean' simulated data to enable more realistic tests of model fitting.

``Noise standard deviation`` is the std.dev of the Gaussian which is used to generate random noise
to be added to the data set. Currently the user must set this to a sensible value based on the
range of the source data.
